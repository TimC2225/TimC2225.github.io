                <p id="Cap1"><b>1.</b> In exercise 1, we used GIMP to edit out the background of a selfie using Raster Editing. After selecting the photo I would be using for the exercise, I started by using the free select lasso tool to trace the outline of my shirt and left half of my face,</p>
                <p id="Cap2"><b>2.</b> Then proceeded to trace out the rest of my head and hair,</p>

                <p id="Cap1"><b>3.</b> Before finally tracing out the rest of my neck and shirt and completing the outline at the original point placed. After this, the selection border was feathered to help make the selection border more smooth, before the selection was inverted to select the background for deletion.</p>
                <p id="Cap2"><b>4.</b> Finally, the smudge tool was used to help make the cropped hair look more natural, thereafter the image was scaled to the desired size and exported as a png to preserve the transparency of the background. The image was then used as part of the "About" portion of this website.</p>

                <p id="Cap1"><b>1.</b> In exercise 2, we used Inkscape to make a vector-based logo for ourselves using Vector Editting. After selecting the photo I would be using as a base for the logo, I started by changing the opacity of the layer containing the image, before tracing the ouline of the head in the picture with the "Draw Bezier curves and straight lines" tool.</p>
                <p id="Cap2"><b>2.</b> I then proceeded to trace out the details of the head, leaving out some details to make my logo design more original.</p>

                <p id="Cap1"><b>3.</b> I then used the fill tool to fill various parts of the logo design with colours matching the photo,</p>
                <p id="Cap2"><b>4.</b> Then changed the filled colours to corresponding shades of grey for the greyscale version.</p>
