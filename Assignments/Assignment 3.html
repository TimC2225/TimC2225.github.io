                <p id="Cap1"><b>1.</b> In exercise 1, we used GIMP to edit out the background of a selfie using Raster Editing. After selecting the photo I would be using for the exercise, I started by using the free select lasso tool to trace the outline of my shirt and left half of my face,</p>
                <p id="Cap2"><b>2.</b> Then proceeded to trace out the rest of my head and hair,</p>

                <p id="Cap1"><b>3.</b> Before finally tracing out the rest of my neck and shirt and completing the outline at the original point placed. After this, the selection border was feathered to help make the selection border more smooth, before the selection was inverted to select the background for deletion.</p>
                <p id="Cap2"><b>4.</b> Finally, the smudge tool was used to help make the cropped hair look more natural, thereafter the image was scaled to the desired size and exported as a png to preserve the transparency of the background. The image was then used as part of the "About" portion of this website.</p>

                <p id="Cap1"><b>1.</b> In exercise 2, we used Inkscape to make a vector-based logo for ourselves using Vector Editting. After selecting the photo I would be using as a base for the logo, I started by changing the opacity of the layer containing the image, before tracing the ouline of the head in the picture with the "Draw Bezier curves and straight lines" tool.</p>
                <p id="Cap2"><b>2.</b> I then proceeded to trace out the details of the head, leaving out some details to make my logo design more original.</p>

                <p id="Cap1"><b>3.</b> I then used the fill tool to fill various parts of the logo design with colours matching the photo,</p>
                <p id="Cap2"><b>4.</b> Then changed the filled colours to corresponding shades of grey for the greyscale version.</p>

                <p id="Cap1"><b>1.</b> For this and the next exercises, we used Fusion 360 to make a sketch based on the design specifications given to us. For this exercise in particular, we made the outline of the design by creating a rectangle and circle using the 2-point rectangle and 2-point circle tools respectively. Afterward, we created another circle of a smaller diameter inside the original circle, beofre trimming off the excess lines. A rectangle was then added to the bottom of the design with dimensions matching the design specs, before the guide line used was trimmed and the completed sketch was extruded by 15mm.</p>
                <p id="Cap2"><b>2.</b> This resulted in the above 3D model.</p>

                <p id="Cap1"><b>1.</b> In exercise 2, we continued using Fusion 360 to construct another sketch. I started by making the outlines of the edges of the design using the circumscribed polygon and center diameter circle tools, before connecting the centres of the two circles using a line.</p>
                <p id="Cap2"><b>2.</b> I then proceeded to construct the rectangles that connect the two circles using the center rectangle tool, with the curved edges of the inner rectangle being made using the 3-tangent circle and trim tools.</p>

                <p id="Cap1"><b>3.</b> I then used the extrude tool to extrude the completed sketch symmetrically about the x-y plane before cutting off some of the top of the extruded portion on the left by 5mm such that the left and right portions of the model are of the same height above the x-y plane.</p>
                <p id="Cap2"><b>4.</b> This resulted in the above 3D model.</p>
