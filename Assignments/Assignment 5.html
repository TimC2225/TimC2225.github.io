                <p id="Cap1"><b>1.</b> For assignment 3, we designed and laser cut a box with a movable lid or door and drawer. I started by designing a basic box with an open front end using the sketch tool, along with another sketch for the middle horizontal piece to fit between the door and the drawers.</p>
                <p id="Cap2"><b>2.</b> Next, I made a sketch for the door of the box and extruded all previous sketches by 3mm. I then made all bodies components and joined then together using the joint tool, then made an initial sketch of the designs for the drawer, before extruding and joining the pieces together to construct the drawer and placing that drawer inside the box.</p>

                <p id="Cap1"><b>3.</b> Finally, I added a chess themed design to the box by adding chess pieces to the side joints, adding the outline of a king piece to the sides of the box, and adding a chessboard design to the top of the box to complete the design. Lastly, I redesigned the front of the drawer to allow it to be easier to pull out.</p>
                <p id="Cap2"><b>4.</b> The final sketches were then exported as .dxf files for laser cutting, and were then brought to the FabLab's laser cutter to be cut. Afterward, the pieces were then put together to result in the final model.</p>
