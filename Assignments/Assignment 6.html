                <p id="Cap1"><b>1.</b> For exercise 11, we made a 3D model of a chess piece. I started by making the base, using the sketch tool to make a circle with a diameter of 30mm as specified, before extruding it. I then imported a screenshot of a pawn, before tracing the pawn's design using the sketch tool onto the y-axis, then spliting the traced design in half, so that I could use the revolve tool to turn the sketch into the completed 3D model. However, since the completed 3D model was too short, the base was extruded further and was filleted to allow the design to fit the specifications.</p>
                <p id="Cap2"><b>2.</b> This resulted in the above 3D model.</p>

                <p id="Cap1"><b>1.</b> In exercise 12, the chess piece designed in exercise 11 was printed using a 3D printer from the FabLab. To do so, the completed 3D model was first imported into the Ultimaker Cura software for slicing. The estimated time to print the model and the gennerated supports was 45 minutes.</p>
                <p id="Cap2"><b>2.</b> The sliced model was then saved as a gcode file and printed using an ultimaker 2+ 3D printer. After removing the support structures, it resulted in the printed model above.</p>

                <p id="Cap1"><b>1.</b> For assignment 4, we were tasked to make a phone stand using a 3D printer. First, I started by making a general outline sketch based on the basic shape of the front end of a jeep. The sketch was then extruded, and a sketch of the mudguards and wheels of the jeep design was made alongside the model along with the design of the bonnet of the jeep on the front top end of the model. Both of these sketches were then extruded.</p>
                <p id="Cap2"><b>2.</b> I then created a sketch for the headlights and other designs on the front of the jeep, and extuded those sketches accordingly. Afterward, I used a sketch of a rectangle, a curved line and the flow tool to create the front bumper of the jeep design.</p>

                <p id="Cap1"><b>3.</b> Finally, used the sketch, extrude, and move tools to create and move the seats of the jeep to their proper positions, before adding more detail to the wheels and extending the rear end of the model to help ensure that the the phone stand would not flip over once a phone was placed on top.</p>
                <p id="Cap2"><b>4.</b> The final model was then placed into the ultimaker cura slicer, before being saved as a gcode file and printed using an ultimaker 2+ 3D printer. After removing the support structures, it resulted in the printed model above.</p>
