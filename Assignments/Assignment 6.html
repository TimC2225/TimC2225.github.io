                <p id="Cap1"><b>1.</b> For exercise 11, we made a 3D model of a chess piece. I started by making the base, using the sketch tool to make a circle with a diameter of 30mm as specified, before extruding it. I then imported a screenshot of a pawn, before tracing the pawn's design using the sketch tool onto the y-axis, then spliting the traced design in half, so that I could use the revolve tool to turn the sketch into the completed 3D model. However, since the completed 3D model was too short, the base was extruded further and was filleted to allow the design to fit the specifications.</p>
                <p id="Cap2"><b>2.</b> This resulted in the above 3D model.</p>

To do so, the completed 3D model was first imported into the Ultimaker Cura software for slicing. The estimated time to print the model and the gennerated supports was 51 minutes.</p>
