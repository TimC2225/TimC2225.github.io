                  <h2>Final Project: Tardis Clock & Lamp</h2>
                  <h2>Ideation:</h2>

                  <p>At the beginning of the project, we went through a brainstorming session to come up with ideas for our final project. During this session, we sketched out 3 possible projects on post-it notes and were then tasked to flesh out one of the 3.</p>
                  <p>My chosen project was a Tardis shaped clock and lamp as shown by the fleshed out design on a piece of A4 paper. The clock/lamp has 5 inputs and 3 outputs, those being:</p>
                  <li>3 Buttons</li>
                  <li>1 Switch</li>
                  <li>1 LDR</li>
                  <li>1 LED</li>
                  <li>1 Neopixel</li>
                  <li>1 LCD display</li>
                  <p>2 of the buttons allow for the time to be set on the LCD display, while the other button controls the lights when the LDR is inactive. The switch is used to activate the LDR, which is then used to contol the lights via the surrounding light level.</p>

                  <h2>Electronics:</h2>

                  <p>Once the project idea was finalised, I began by designing the electronic internals in Tinkercad.</p>
                  <p>This resulted in the simulation on the left, which was then further modified once translated to physical components on a breadboard.</p>

                  <p id="F1P">These modifications gave the LCD clock display the ability to display the current time up to the current second, with the hours and minutes now being displayed on the left side of the display on the top and bottom respectively.</p>
                  <p>The code was also changed to more accurately follow the current time.</p>

                  <h2>3D Modelling:</h2>
                  <iframe id="AV2v3" src="https://ichat3068.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH512d4QTec90decfa6e01ae364e98153988?mode=embed" height="45%" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>
                  <p>After completing the electronic portion of the project, I began modelling the shell of the clock/lamp after the shape of the Tardis from Doctor Who. </p>
                  <p>This resulted in the initial design shown on the right, where most of the model was made to be printed using the 3D printers available in the FabLab. However, since the print time was found to be too long (18 hours) for the main body portion of the shell, I changed the design to use more laser cut pieces, specifically using the laser cutter to cut out the sides and base of the design.</p>
                  <img id="AV3v2" src="Images/Final Project/3D Modelling.jpg">
                  <p id="F2P">This design was then fabricated, with the 3D printing times being drastically reduced to about 4 hours per piece. This resulted in the unpainted shell shown on the left.</p>
                  <p>The shell was then painted blue using an airbrush and white printer paper was also used to cover up the transparent acrylic pieces that were added as "windows", so as to make the shell look more like the Tardis.</p>

                  <h2>Integration:</h2>
                  <img id="AV2v2" src="Images/Final Project/Final.jpg">
                  <p>Following this, the electronic components were then placed inside the shell, with the inputs being held in place in the front acrylic plate using glue. However, in the process of adding in the LED on the top of the shell, the original top piece broke off and as a result was excluded from the final model.</p>
                  <p>This resulted in the final model as shown on the right.</p>
